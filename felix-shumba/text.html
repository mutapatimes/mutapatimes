        <div class="fs-text-body">
          <p>My practice begins with the land — its colours, its textures, its silences. Growing up in Harare, I was surrounded by the evidence of layered histories: colonial architecture beside market stalls, ancient kopjes rising behind new concrete, the smell of red earth after rain. These juxtapositions have shaped the way I see and the way I make.</p>

          <p>In painting, I work between figuration and abstraction, building surfaces through repeated gestures of layering and scraping. The canvas becomes a kind of archaeology — each mark a deposit, each erasure a revelation. I am drawn to the moment when an image begins to emerge from accumulated material, the way a face or a landscape asserts itself through process rather than intention.</p>

          <p>My mixed media works extend this impulse into the physical world. I gather materials — soil from construction sites, fabric from second-hand markets, wire from fences — and incorporate them into compositions that hold the memory of their origins. These are not collages in the decorative sense; they are attempts to make visible the networks of labour, migration, and exchange that connect us to place.</p>

          <p>In sculpture, I engage with Zimbabwe's great tradition of stone carving while pushing toward more industrial materials — welded steel, cast bronze, found metal. The human figure recurs across all three practices, not as portrait but as presence: the body as site of cultural inscription, as vessel of ancestral knowledge, as evidence of survival and transformation.</p>

          <p>I think of my work as a form of translation — between past and present, between material and meaning, between the deeply personal and the broadly shared. If these translations are always imperfect, that imperfection is itself the subject: the gaps, the slippages, the beautiful failures of memory.</p>

        <h2 class="fs-text-article-title">Material Memories: On the Work of Felix Shumba</h2>
        <p class="fs-text-meta">By Dr. Tendai Moyo, 2024. Published in <em>Contemporary African Art Review</em></p>
        <div class="fs-text-body">
          <p>Felix Shumba's practice resists easy categorisation. Working across painting, mixed media assemblage, and sculpture, he produces objects that are at once materially specific and emotionally expansive. His canvases, often built up over weeks or months through successive layers of oil, acrylic, and found pigment, possess a geological quality — as though the surface of the painting were itself a kind of terrain, compressed and stratified by time.</p>

          <p>The mixed media works push this logic further, incorporating literal fragments of the physical world: red laterite soil, strips of chitenge fabric, lengths of copper wire. In <em>Kudzoka I</em> (2025), these materials form a dense, tactile field that evokes the sensory experience of Harare's Mbare market — its colours, its textures, its layered histories of trade and exchange. The work asks us to read materials not merely as formal elements but as bearers of social meaning.</p>

          <p>In his sculptural work, Shumba engages in a productive dialogue with Zimbabwe's celebrated stone carving tradition, bringing the organic forms of serpentine and springstone into conversation with the industrial geometry of welded steel. The resulting hybrid forms suggest a culture in transition — honouring the past while forging new vocabularies for the present.</p>

        <h2 class="fs-text-article-title">Between Earth and Iron</h2>
        <p class="fs-text-meta">By Sarah Thornton, 2023. Exhibition catalogue, <em>Chimurenga Rising</em>, Zeitz MOCAA</p>
        <div class="fs-text-body">
          <p>There is a quiet intensity to Felix Shumba's sculptures that rewards slow looking. Pieces like <em>Chimurenga</em> (2025) and <em>Musoro</em> (2024) appear, at first glance, to be studies in formal contrast: the soft curves of carved stone set against the angular planes of forged metal. But spend time with these works and other registers emerge — spiritual, political, deeply personal.</p>

          <p>The title <em>Chimurenga</em>, meaning "revolutionary struggle" in Shona, signals the political dimension of Shumba's project. Yet the work resists didacticism. Its power lies not in message but in presence: the sheer physical weight and dignity of the form, the way it occupies space with both stillness and tension. These are sculptures that ask to be walked around, encountered from multiple angles, understood through the body as much as through the mind.</p>
